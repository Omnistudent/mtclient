In case you downloaded the source code:
---------------------------------------
If you downloaded the Minetest Engine source code in which this file is
contained, you probably want to download the minetest_game project too:
  https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/
See the README.txt in it.

This game is not finished
--------------------------
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs. When doing that, debug.txt is useful.

Default Controls
-----------------
- WASD: move
- Space: jump/climb
- Shift: sneak/go down
- Q: drop item
- I: inventory
- Mouse: turn/look
- Mouse left: dig/punch
- Mouse right: place/use

- Settable in the configuration file, see the section below.

Paths
------
$bin   - Compiled binaries
$share - Distributed read-only data
$user  - User-created modifiable data

Windows .zip / RUN_IN_PLACE source:
$bin   = bin
$share = .
$user  = .

Linux installed:
$bin   = /usr/bin
$share = /usr/share/minetest
$user  = ~/.minetest

OS X:
$bin   = ?
$share = ?
$user  = ~/Library/Application Support/minetest

World directory
----------------
- Worlds can be found as separate folders in:
    $user/worlds/

Configuration file:
-------------------
- Default location:
    $user/minetest.conf
- It is created by Minetest when it is ran the first time.
- A specific file can be specified on the command line:
	--config <path-to-file>

Command-line options:
---------------------
- Use --help

Compiling on GNU/Linux:
-----------------------

Install dependencies. Here's an example for Debian/Ubuntu:
$ apt-get install build-essential libirrlicht-dev cmake libbz2-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg8-dev libxxf86vm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfreetype6-dev

Download source, extract (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times):
$ wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest/tarball/master -O master.tar.gz
$ tar xf master.tar.gz
$ cd minetest-minetest-286edd4 (or similar)

Download minetest_game (otherwise only the "Minimal development test" game is available)
$ cd games/
$ wget https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/tarball/master -O minetest_game.tar.gz
$ tar xf minetest_game.tar.gz
$ mv minetest-minetest_game-* minetest_game
$ cd ..

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:
$ cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1
$ make -j2

Run it:
$ cd bin
$ ./minetest

- Use cmake . -LH to see all CMake options and their current state
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package), you will want to use -DRUN_IN_PLACE=0
- You can build a bare server or a bare client by specifying -DBUILD_CLIENT=0 or -DBUILD_SERVER=0
- You can select between Release and Debug build by -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>
  - Debug build is slower, but gives much more useful output in a debugger
- If you build a bare server, you don't need to have Irrlicht installed. In that case use -DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=/the/irrlicht/source

Compiling on Windows:
---------------------
- This section is outdated. In addition to what is described here:
  - In addition to minetest, you need to download minetest_game.
  - If you wish to have sound support, you need libogg, libvorbis and libopenal

- You need:
	* CMake:
		http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
	* MinGW or Visual Studio
		http://www.mingw.org/
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default
	* Irrlicht SDK 1.7:
		http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
	* Zlib headers (zlib125.zip)
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* Zlib library (zlibwapi.lib and zlibwapi.dll from zlib125dll.zip):
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* Optional: gettext library and tools:
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php
		- This is used for other UI languages. Feel free to leave it out.
	* And, of course, Minetest:
		http://minetest.net/download.php
- Steps:
	- Select a directory called DIR hereafter in which you will operate.
	- Make sure you have CMake and a compiler installed.
	- Download all the other stuff to DIR and extract them into there.
	  ("extract here", not "extract to packagename/")
	  NOTE: zlib125dll.zip needs to be extracted into zlib125dll
	- All those packages contain a nice base directory in them, which
	  should end up being the direct subdirectories of DIR.
	- You will end up with a directory structure like this (+=dir, -=file):
	-----------------
	+ DIR
		- zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
		- zlib125dll.zip
		- irrlicht-1.7.1.zip
		- 110214175330.zip (or whatever, this is the minetest source)
		+ zlib-1.2.5
			- zlib.h
			+ win32
			...
		+ zlib125dll
			- readme.txt
			+ dll32
			...
		+ irrlicht-1.7.1
			+ lib
			+ include
			...
		+ gettext (optional)
			+bin
			+include
			+lib
		+ minetest
			+ src
			+ doc
			- CMakeLists.txt
			...
	-----------------
	- Start up the CMake GUI
	- Select "Browse Source..." and select DIR/minetest
	- Now, if using MSVC:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest-build
	- Else if using MinGW:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest
	- Select "Configure"
	- Select your compiler
	- It will warn about missing stuff, ignore that at this point. (later don't)
	- Make sure the configuration is as follows
	  (note that the versions may differ for you):
	-----------------
	BUILD_CLIENT             [X]
	BUILD_SERVER             [ ]
	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         Release
	CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX     DIR/minetest-install
	IRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR      DIR/irrlicht-1.7.1
	RUN_IN_PLACE             [X]
	WARN_ALL                 [ ]
	ZLIB_DLL                 DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.dll
	ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR         DIR/zlib-1.2.5
	ZLIB_LIBRARIES           DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.lib
	GETTEXT_BIN_DIR          DIR/gettext/bin
	GETTEXT_INCLUDE_DIR      DIR/gettext/include
	GETTEXT_LIBRARIES        DIR/gettext/lib/intl.lib
	GETTEXT_MSGFMT           DIR/gettext/bin/msgfmt
	-----------------
	- Hit "Configure"
	- Hit "Configure" once again 8)
	- If something is still coloured red, you have a problem.
	- Hit "Generate"
	If using MSVC:
		- Open the generated minetest.sln
		- The project defaults to the "Debug" configuration. Make very sure to
		  select "Release", unless you want to debug some stuff (it's slower
		  and might not even work at all)
		- Build the ALL_BUILD project
		- Build the INSTALL project
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest-install/bin/minetest.exe
		- Additionally you may create a zip package by building the PACKAGE
		  project.
	If using MinGW:
		- Using the command line, browse to the build directory and run 'make'
		  (or mingw32-make or whatever it happens to be)
		- You may need to copy some of the downloaded DLLs into bin/, see what
		  running the produced executable tells you it doesn't have.
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest/bin/minetest.exe

Windows releases of minetest are built using a bat script like this:

set builddir=%sourcedir%\bvc10
mkdir %builddir%
pushd %builddir%
cmake %sourcedir% -G "Visual Studio 10" -DIRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR=%irrlichtpath% -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%installpath%
if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto fail
"C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe" ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
